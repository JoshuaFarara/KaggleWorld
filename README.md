# Kaggle World

I enjoy exploring and analyzing datasets on various subjects. The thrill for me is in extracting meaningful insights that can empower a business or company.

This project showcases my passion for data analytics and data science while honing my skills in Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

I utilize a Flask backend as the web framework to present my work through a portfolio and blog. The data display is showcased using a website integrated with an interactive dashboard highlighting articles and visualizations about the data.

## Key Features:
Jupyter Notebook analysis template generator script
Flask web framework
Dashboard of visualizations and insights using HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, and JavaScript
Kaggle API for dataset downloading
