  "descriptionNullable": "\n\nThis dataset contains extensive health information for 2,149 patients, each uniquely identified with IDs ranging from 4751 to 6900. The dataset includes demographic details, lifestyle factors, medical history, clinical measurements, cognitive and functional assessments, symptoms, and a diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease. The data is ideal for researchers and data scientists looking to explore factors associated with Alzheimer's, develop predictive models, and conduct statistical analyses.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n1. **Patient Information**\n   - Patient ID\n   - Demographic Details\n   - Lifestyle Factors\n2. **Medical History**\n3. **Clinical Measurements**\n4. **Cognitive and Functional Assessments**\n5. **Symptoms**\n6. **Diagnosis Information**\n7. **Confidential Information**\n\n## Patient Information\n\n### Patient ID\n\n- **PatientID**: A unique identifier assigned to each patient (4751 to 6900).\n\n### Demographic Details\n\n- **Age**: The age of the patients ranges from 60 to 90 years.\n- **Gender**: Gender of the patients, where 0 represents Male and 1 represents Female.\n- **Ethnicity**: The ethnicity of the patients, coded as follows:\n  - 0: Caucasian\n  - 1: African American\n  - 2: Asian\n  - 3: Other\n- **EducationLevel**: The education level of the patients, coded as follows:\n  - 0: None\n  - 1: High School\n  - 2: Bachelor's\n  - 3: Higher\n\n### Lifestyle Factors\n\n- **BMI**: Body Mass Index of the patients, ranging from 15 to 40.\n- **Smoking**: Smoking status, where 0 indicates No and 1 indicates Yes.\n- **AlcoholConsumption**: Weekly alcohol consumption in units, ranging from 0 to 20.\n- **PhysicalActivity**: Weekly physical activity in hours, ranging from 0 to 10.\n- **DietQuality**: Diet quality score, ranging from 0 to 10.\n- **SleepQuality**: Sleep quality score, ranging from 4 to 10.\n\n## Medical History\n\n- **FamilyHistoryAlzheimers**: Family history of Alzheimer's Disease, where 0 indicates No and 1 indicates Yes.\n- **CardiovascularDisease**: Presence of cardiovascular disease, where 0 indicates No and 1 indicates Yes.\n- **Diabetes**: Presence of diabetes, where 0 indicates No and 1 indicates Yes.\n- **Depression**: Presence of depression, where 0 indicates No and 1 indicates Yes.\n- **HeadInjury**: History of head injury, where 0 indicates No and 1 indicates Yes.\n- **Hypertension**: Presence of hypertension, where 0 indicates No and 1 indicates Yes.\n\n## Clinical Measurements\n\n- **SystolicBP**: Systolic blood pressure, ranging from 90 to 180 mmHg.\n- **DiastolicBP**: Diastolic blood pressure, ranging from 60 to 120 mmHg.\n- **CholesterolTotal**: Total cholesterol levels, ranging from 150 to 300 mg/dL.\n- **CholesterolLDL**: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, ranging from 50 to 200 mg/dL.\n- **CholesterolHDL**: High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, ranging from 20 to 100 mg/dL.\n- **CholesterolTriglycerides**: Triglycerides levels, ranging from 50 to 400 mg/dL.\n\n## Cognitive and Functional Assessments\n\n- **MMSE**: Mini-Mental State Examination score, ranging from 0 to 30. Lower scores indicate cognitive impairment.\n- **FunctionalAssessment**: Functional assessment score, ranging from 0 to 10. Lower scores indicate greater impairment.\n- **MemoryComplaints**: Presence of memory complaints, where 0 indicates No and 1 indicates Yes.\n- **BehavioralProblems**: Presence of behavioral problems, where 0 indicates No and 1 indicates Yes.\n- **ADL**: Activities of Daily Living score, ranging from 0 to 10.

It is ideal for developing predictive models, conducting statistical analyses, and exploring the complex interplay of factors contributing to Alzheimer's Disease.\n\n## This Dataset was Cited By: \n\n<br>**Title:** [Rapid Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis Using Advanced Artificial Intelligence Algorithms](https://www.ijisrt.com/assets/upload/files/IJISRT24JUN1915.pdf)\n\n<br>**DOI:** [10.38124/ijisrt/IJISRT24JUN1915](https://doi.org/10.38124/ijisrt/IJISRT24JUN1915)\n\n<br>**Abstract:** Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia, predominantly impacting the elderly and characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Early and precise detection is critical for effective management and improved patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods such as neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis are often invasive, expensive, and time-consuming. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) provide promising alternatives that are non-invasive, efficient, and cost-effective. This study explores the application of various ML algorithms to predict Alzheimer's disease. The methodology involved data preprocessing and feature selection using the Spearman algorithm to enhance computational efficiency and model performance. We evaluated k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Trees (DT), and Ensemble methods. Results indicate that the Ensemble method achieved a predictive accuracy of 94.07% using only 13 features. These results demonstrate the potential of ML algorithms in revolutionizing AD diagnostics, offering scalable and accurate solutions for early detection.\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you use this dataset in your work, please cite it as follows:\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{rabie_el_kharoua_2024,\n\ttitle={Alzheimer's Disease Dataset},\n\turl={https://www.kaggle.com/dsv/8668279},\n\tDOI={10.34740/KAGGLE/DSV/8668279},\n\tpublisher={Kaggle},\n\tauthor={Rabie El Kharoua},\n\tyear={2024}\n}\n```\n\n## Dataset Usage and Attribution Notice\n\nThis dataset, shared by Rabie El Kharoua, is original and has never been shared before.
