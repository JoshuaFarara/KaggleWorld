# ## About Data
# 
# Title: Dataset Title
# 
# Dataset: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ihelon/coffee-sales/data)
# 
# Description of data:
# 
# This dataset contains detailed records of coffee sales from a vending machine. It is intended for analysis of purchasing patterns, sales trends, and customer preferences related to coffee products. The dataset spans from March 2024 to June 2024, capturing daily transaction data. And it's continue added new information.

# ### Kernel Version Used
# 
# Python==3.11.7

# %% [markdown]
# ## Import Libraries
# 
# We will use the following librariesÂ¶
# 1. Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
# 2. Numpy: Numerical operations and calculations
# 3. Matplotlib: Data visualization and plotting
# 4. Seaborn: Enhanced data visualization and statistical graphics
# 5. Scipy: Scientific computing and advanced mathematical operations

# %%
# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import scipy as sp

# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
import sys

# Get the directory of the current script
script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

# Change the working directory to the script's directory
os.chdir(script_dir)

for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session

# ## Data Loading and Exploration | Cleaning

# %% [markdown]
# ### Load a CSV file then creating a dataframe

# %%
# Kaggle Notebook
# df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/coffee-sales/index.csv')


#Local Machine Notebook
df = pd.read_csv('../../data/coffee_sales_data.csv')


# %% [markdown]
# ### Set the option to show maximum columns

# %%
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None) 
pd.set_option('display.max_rows', None)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Get a sneak peek of data
# The purpose of a sneak peek is to get a quick overview of the data and identify any potential problems or areas of interest

# %%
df.head(5)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Let's see the column names

# %%
df.columns

# %% [markdown]
# ### Let's have a look on the shape of the dataset

# %%
print(f"The Number of Rows are {df.shape[0]}, and columns are {df.shape[1]}.")

# %% [markdown]
# ### Let's have a look on the columns and their data types using detailed info function

# %%
df.info()

# %% [markdown]
# ### Count the missing values

# %%
df.isnull().sum()

# %% [markdown]
# ## Cleaning Set 1
# 
# * There are 896 rows, and 6 columns in the dataset.
# 
# * The data type of all columns are objects except for df['money'] which is float.
# 
# * The columns in the datasets are:
#     * 'date', 'datetime', 'cash_type', 'card', 'money', 'coffee_name'
#     
# * There are a few missing values in the dataset, which we will read in detail and deal with later on in the notebook.
# 
# * rename columns 'cash_type':'payment_type','card':'card_number', 'money':'amount_paid_uah'
# 
# * datetime can be split into two columns and drop column time, because data already has a column that satisfies date.
# 
# * money column after renaming 'amount_paid_uah' can derive an exchanged USD column for later comparison and analysis
# 
# 
# 

# %% [markdown]
# ### Task:
# 
# Clean the data by changing column names 
# 
# 
# 1. Change column names to appropriate names matching the data.
# 2. 

# %% [markdown]
# ## Changing column names 
# 
# Changed: cash_type to payment_type since cash and card payments are accepted

# %%
df.rename(columns={'cash_type':'payment_type', 'card':'card_number', 'money':'amount_paid_uah'}, inplace=True)

# %%
df.columns

# %% [markdown]
# ## Creating Time Column

# %%
df[['new_date', 'time']] =df['datetime'].str.split(' ', n=1, expand=True)
df = df.drop(['new_date', 'datetime'], axis=1)
# df = ['date', 'time', 'payment_type', 'card_number', 'amount_paid_usd', 'coffee_name']

# %%
# check the data
df.head()


# %%
# df['time']

# %% [markdown]
# ## Convert amount_paid_uah(formerly df['money']) to USD.

# %% [markdown]
# .024 USD  = 1 Ukrainian hryvnia
# 
# 1 USD = 40.3317	Ukrainian hryvnia

# %%
UAH_to_USD = .024
df['amount_paid_usd'] = df['amount_paid_uah'] * UAH_to_USD

# %%
df.head(5)
